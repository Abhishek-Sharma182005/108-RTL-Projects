# Project_1 - Building Blocks

## Overview

This repository contains the building blocks for various digital design projects. The focus is on creating fundamental components and modules that can be used in more complex systems. Below is an overview of the completed projects and their components.

## Completed Projects

- **Customized Clock Dividers:** Various clock dividers have been designed and customized for different frequencies and applications. These are essential for generating clock signals at different rates.
- **Basic Logic Gates:** Implementations of fundamental logic gates.
- **Ripple Carry Adder:** A simple adder designed for basic arithmetic operations.
- **Multiplexers and Demultiplexers:** Essential components for data routing.
- **Registers:** Storage elements used to hold data temporarily.
- **State Machines:** Used for modeling sequential logic systems.

## Aims and Objectives

The aim of this project is to develop and implement fundamental digital building blocks that can be used as components in larger systems. These include:

- **Design and Implementation of Customizable Clock Dividers:** Creating clock dividers that can be tailored for different frequencies.
- **Creation of Basic Logic Gates:** Implementing logic gates using NAND and NOR gates.
- **Development of Complex Modules:** Such as adders, multiplexers, and state machines.

## Future Work

The following components are planned but not yet made:

- **Advanced Clock Dividers:** More complex and efficient clock dividers.
- **Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs):** For performing arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Memory Units:** For data storage and retrieval.
- **Customizable State Machines:** For more flexible and varied sequential logic designs.

## Getting Started

To get started with these building blocks, clone this repository and explore the various projects and their implementations. 

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

### Notes:
1. **Replace `<repository-url>`** with the actual URL of your repository.
2. **Add a `LICENSE` file** if you want to include a license section.
3. **Customize further** based on your specific needs or additional details about your projects.

Save this content in a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project. It should render nicely on GitHub or any other platform that supports Markdown.
