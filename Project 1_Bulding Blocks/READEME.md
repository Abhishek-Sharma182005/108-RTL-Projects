    <h1>Project_1 - Building Blocks</h1>

    <p>This repository contains the building blocks for various digital design projects. The focus is on creating fundamental components and modules that can be used in more complex systems. Below is an overview of the completed projects and their components.</p>

    <h2>Completed Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customized Clock Dividers:</strong> Various clock dividers have been designed and customized for different frequencies and applications. These are essential for generating clock signals at different rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Projects:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Logic Gates</li>
                <li>Ripple Carry Adder</li>
                <li>Multiplexers and Demultiplexers</li>
                <li>Registers</li>
                <li>State Machines</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>
    <p>The aim of this project is to develop and implement fundamental digital building blocks that can be used as components in larger systems. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design and implementation of customizable clock dividers.</li>
        <li>Creation of basic logic gates using NAND and NOR gates.</li>
        <li>Development of more complex modules like adders and multiplexers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>The following components are planned but not yet made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advanced Clock Dividers</li>
        <li>Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)</li>
        <li>Memory Units</li>
        <li>Customizable State Machines</li>
    </ul>
