## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), a fundamental digital circuit used for binary addition. The Ripple Carry Adder consists of a series of full adders connected in a chain, where the carry output from each full adder is used as the carry input for the next.

## Ripple Carry Adder

### Description

The Ripple Carry Adder is a straightforward approach to performing binary addition. It consists of multiple full adders connected in series, where each full adder computes the sum and carry-out for a single bit of the binary numbers being added.

### Why Choose a Ripple Carry Adder?

The Ripple Carry Adder is chosen for its simplicity and ease of implementation. It serves as a basis for understanding more complex adder designs and provides valuable insights into digital circuit design principles.

#### RTL Code

The RTL code for the Ripple Carry Adder is implemented in [SystemVerilog], detailing the functionality of each full adder and the interconnections between them.

#### Testbench

A comprehensive testbench is provided to validate the functionality of the Ripple Carry Adder. It includes test cases that cover various input scenarios and verify the correctness of the output.

## Explanation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the Ripple Carry Adder's operation, including how the carry is propagated through the series of full adders and how the sum and carry-out are computed.

## Usage
